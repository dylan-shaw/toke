When I went to the grocery store two days ago, I purchased a loaf of bread.
I then went home and made a sandwich. It was then that my dog decided to
jump onto the counter and eat my sandwich. I made another sandwich, and ate
it promptly. The dog and I then decided to talk a walk. Upon reaching the front
door, I realized it was snowing. I put gloves on and dog mittens onto my dog.
We then went out for a walk out in the snow.
